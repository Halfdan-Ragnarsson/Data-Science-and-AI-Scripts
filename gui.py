'''
What is this?
This is a a Python program that illustrates the K nearest neighbors progam
using a csv to make recommendation on the best matches.
This is illustrated using a GUI that showcases to the use the best neighbors for their
selected data point.
The only caveat to this is that if the CSV is formatted in a different way, this will fail
